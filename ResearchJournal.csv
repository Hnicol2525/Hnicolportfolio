left,Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster,"French Visual Artist, 1965 - Current","Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster is a French artist born in 1965. She has many interactive and static artworks and exhibits. She was obsessed with the study and relationship of bodies and spaces. Her work Seance de shadow II, pictured left, is an example of her exploration of interactivity and people. It utilises infrared sensors to determine when a person is near and then illuminates a deep blue light casting a shadow on the wall. This project relates to assignment 2C as the physical computing aspect of bodies and the interaction between people and computers to create art and interactivity.",https://media.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T12/T12752_639438_9.jpg,,"Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster, ""Seance de Shadow II (bleu)""",,https://www.estherschipper.com/artists/39-dominique-gonzalez-foerster/,"Visual Art, Bodies-In-Space, Artist",

The exhibit is able to last for up to 3 years and displays a robot helplessly trying to put fluid back into itself and the fluid rapidly escapes from its body.

The landing page allows you to scroll through their works, then a crystal appears on the page and follows you, enticing you to click. You are then directed to a cloud of works that you can move through an engage with. This is inspiring for 2A the interactivity feels simple but allows for such a complex display of information that isnt overwhelming.","https://res.cloudinary.com/olafureliasson-net/image/private/q_auto:eco,c_fit,h_1920,w_1920/img/the-weather-project_3856.webp",,"Project ""The Weather Project"" 2003",,https://olafureliasson.net/,"Webdesign, coding, interactive, website",

In his piece, Fight!, utilises a VR headset and feeds the viewer two completely different and contrasting images in either eye. Memo was fascinated with the visual interpretation of the brain and rather than focusing on one image or the other, the eyes fight and create a patchwork of both images at once. Everyone will see something different with their own interpretation of the images combination. This work was motivated to question reality and perception through interactive and engaging coding.",https://www.memo.tv/wpmemo/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/MemoAkten_2017_FightArs_01-scaled.jpg,,Fight! 2017 installation view,,https://www.memo.tv/,"AI Whisperer, Researcher, Artist, Muscisian",
